Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished he kept adding new material and edited one volume after another for publication.', 'General', 'images/inSearch.jpg'),

As a founding work of modern Western literature and the earliest canonical novel,[citation needed] it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published, such as the Bokklubben World Library collection that cites Don Quixote as the authors\' choice for the \"best literary work ever written\".[2]\r\nThe story follows the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) named Alonso Quixano who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his sanity and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante), reviving chivalry and serving his country, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha.\r\n', 'Fantasy', 'images/donQuixote.jpg'),

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\'s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream', 'series', 'images/theGreat.jpg'),
(21, 'akshita123', 'hamlet', 'Shakespeare', 'The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (/\'h√¶ml?t/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602.

Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805,[4] were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.[5]\r\nTolstoy said War and Peace is \"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle\".\r\n\r\n', 'General', 'images/warandpeace.jpg'),
